				<h3>Data Shows Faculty Diversity is Still a Problem</h3>
				<p><i>By Gabriel Glynn-Habron</i>
</p>

			<div class="col-lg-12">

				<p>Much has been made about the issue of racial diversity amongst student bodies in higher education. Policies such as affirmative action have been at the crux of cable news debates for decades. With so much stress and attention on the issue of student diversity the topic of faculty diversity has gone largely unnoticed.  Data however shows that while colleges are attempting, and in many cases succeeding, to diversify their student body, faculty positions especially high-ranking professor positions, are still largely dominated by white people. </p>
				<p>From campus to campus across much of the country many faculty positions are still highly segregated. While the student of color population grew from <a href="https://www.aacu.org/aacu-news/newsletter/2019/march/facts-figures">1996-2016</a> by just over 15%, professors are still by in large white. 
</p>
				<p>The United States has long struggled since the Civil Rights movement to break down the larger systems of power and influence that have remained largely white. While the Civil Rights movement of the 60’s helped to remove and outlaw blatant governmental racism, much of the societal and systemic effects are still there. Many institutions, professions, and companies have been opened up to larger numbers of racial minorities; but there is still a general lack of people of color in executive and leadership positions. 
</p>
				<p>In an academic context this issue has manifested itself in the sharp drop-off in minority professors in higher ranking positions. The hierarchy of faculty positions is extremely important not only because of the increased level of pay and acknowledgment but also because of the power and decision making that usually correlates with each rank.</p>

				<p>One major system that academia employs is that of “tenure”. According to the <a href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure">American Association of University Professors</a>(AAUP), a tenured appointment is an “indefinite appointment that can be terminated only for cause or under extraordinary circumstances such as financial exigency and program discontinuation”. </p>
				<p>Tenure is an important aspect of the academic workspace because it helps to protect and legitimize the research and teaching practices of professors. The AAUP writes that tenure “provides the conditions for faculty to pursue research and innovation and draw evidence-based conclusions free from corporate or political pressure”.</p>
				<p>Dr. Cynthia P. King, a professor of Communication Studies at Furman University has spent much of her time focused on Black and African American rhetoric and public discourse. King believes that “There is still an extra barrier or burden” for professors of color, especially for black professors in moving up the faculty ladder. King went on to say, “To get tenure in institutions in general, some more than others, it is an arduous process, and we are finding with African Americans there is a kind of racial tax and there’s a burden you bear being in a majority white space”.</p>
				<p>	This “tax” or “burden” is a common experience amongst minority professors, especially black professors across the country.</p>
				<p>High level academic Dr. Cornel West was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/07/13/cornel-west-harvard-tenure-resignation/">denied</a> tenure this year at his alma mater Harvard after a highly esteemed career that included positions at both Yale and Princeton. Also, this year, famed journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones <a href="https://ncpolicywatch.com/2021/07/06/nikole-hannah-jones-declines-unc-tenure-offer-heads-to-howard-university/">turned down</a> a position at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill after disputes over tenure. </p>
				<p>In a 2019 <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/race-on-campus/2021-01-26">survey</a> by the University of Southern California 72% of black faculty members said “they needed to work harder to gain respect” while just 46% of white faculty felt the same way. </p>
				<p>The issue of feeling uncomfortable within a workspace is something that black and minority people not just in academia but in the country as whole have had to grapple with for years. Dr. King expressed similar sentiments when discussing the topic of the lack of diversity she encountered growing up and moving through the world of higher education, “In the world I grew up that just the way it was, those spaces and those people who were represented in those spaces, who were empowered in those spaces were not people who looked like me”.</p>
				<p>Although overall college populations are diversifying there is still an extremely large gap in racial diversity amongst high-level students. In 2018 there were over 107,000 white students who earned their doctorate, the next closest group represented was “non-resident alien” with just under 24,000 students.</p>
				<p>In order to increase the overall diversity of professors it is necessary to improve the numbers of people of color who receive high level degrees.</p>

				<p>Other than the obvious influence of different populations of each racial group, Dr. Cynthia King attributes much of the reasoning for why there are less minority professors to the “opportunity gap” that many students of color face. King talked about her own experience growing up saying that “Every space of power, public sphere, every sector of the public sphere… was predominated by whites and certainly led by whites, so you acclimated and adjusted and came to accept that”. </p>
				<p>According to King, the issue of faculty diversity is important to students because it “is something that’s always been, we are diverse… and so understanding that and not being threatened by that and viewing it as a good can benefit everyone in the community”.</p>
				<p>For colleges the problem of faculty diversity specifically amongst professors is something that must be addressed to continue to maintain and encourage a more diverse student body. Dr. King argues that schools and institutions “need to become this place where diversity can thrive and prosper”, part of doing that includes hiring a more diverse set of professors. While so many schools love to feature a racially diverse set of students in commercials and pamphlets, the people teaching classes and handing out grades look practically the same as they always have. </p>
